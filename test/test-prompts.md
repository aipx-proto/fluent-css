# Test Prompts

---

The image @index.png shows the rendered visual of @index.html . Using these as baseline examples of html, can you please write a new @test.html  page to look something like @test.png ? Do not look at any other files. Primarily focus on layout, do not "visual" styles to elements like buttons, inputs, links, instead let the imported styles do their work.

**The Task**

Using @index.html as baseline examples of html with the mirai.css library, please look at @test.png and write a new @test.html page

**Rules**
- Do not look at any other files other than those mentioned
- The imported `mirai.css` file contains styles for most native html elements. This includes: input, button, a, all text elements, dialog, details, progress, select, textarea, radio, checkbox, table. Do not style these elements directly other than for layout purposes
- Use the markup in @index.html as an example of using mirai.css
