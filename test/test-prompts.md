# Test Prompts

---

The image @index.png shows the rendered visual of @index.html . Using these as baseline examples of html, can you please write a new @test.html  page to look something like @test.png ? Do not look at any other files. Primarily focus on layout, do not "visual" styles to elements like buttons, inputs, links, instead let the imported styles do their work.
