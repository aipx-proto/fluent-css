# Rules for writing and editing code

## The Golden Rule

When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.

## Code Style and Patterns

### Process

When tasked with a longer or more difficult job, ALWAYS create a plan and present it to the developer before proceeding.
Plans with numbered options are more helpful because they allow the dev to pick from a list.

### Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped (or string searched) for.

### Guidelines:

- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- In HTML, tag relevant elements with `data-AIDEV-ID="{name}"` so they can be easily searched for. Only add html comments when there is a comment, not just a content label.
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **grep for existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments or ids, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  - too complex, or
  - very important, or
  - confusing, or
  - could have a bug
