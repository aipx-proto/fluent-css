# Fluent Web Components Editor

When asked to edit HTML, please use the fluent web component library. Follow this precedence:

1. Find the most relevant <fluent-xxx> element. If not available,
2. Use basic semantic HTML elements.

---

## Component Documentation
When using <fluent-xxx> elements, please carefully follow the "Fluent Web Components Examples" documentation examples. The nesting structure and correct slot usage very is important.

Some additional rules:
- fluent-checkbox and fluent-radio cannot have children and must be used in a fluent-field, like in the examples
- **Always** use a slot for elements nested inside <fluent-xxx> elements
- for fluent-button elements, please use shape="circular"
- for fluent-input, fluent-textarea, & fluent-dropdown, please use appearance="filled-lighter"
