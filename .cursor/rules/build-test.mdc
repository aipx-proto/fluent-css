**The Task**
The image [index.png](mdc:index.png) shows the rendered visual of [index.html](mdc:index.html) . 
Using these as baseline examples of html, please look at [test.png](mdc:test/test.png) and write a new [test.html](mdc:test/test.html) page

**Rules**
- Do not look at any other files other than those mentioned
- The imported `mirai.css` file contains styles for most native html elements. This includes: input, button, a, all text elements, dialog, details, progress, select, textarea, radio, checkbox, table. Do not style these elements directly other than for layout purposes
- Use the markup in [index.html](mdc:index.html) as an example of using mirai.css
